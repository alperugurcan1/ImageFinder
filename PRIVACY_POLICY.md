# Privacy Policy for ImageFinder

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

ImageFinder is a minimal desktop application that lets you search for images by keyword and save them to your desktop. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your information.

## Data Collection

**ImageFinder does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

- No account creation or login required
- No analytics or usage tracking
- No data sent to our servers (we have no servers)

## How the App Works

1. **Keywords you type** – When you enter a word (e.g., "horse") and press Enter, the app sends that keyword to [Lorem Flickr](https://loremflickr.com) to fetch a matching image. This request goes directly from your device to Lorem Flickr.

2. **Images** – Images are downloaded from Lorem Flickr and saved to your Windows Desktop folder. They are stored only on your computer.

3. **Local storage** – The app does not store any data locally beyond the image files you choose to save.

## Third-Party Services

- **Lorem Flickr** – Used to fetch images based on your search keywords. Their privacy practices apply to requests made to their service. See [loremflickr.com](https://loremflickr.com) for more information.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties. The only external communication is the image request to Lorem Flickr when you search, which is sent directly from your device.

## Children's Privacy

ImageFinder does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is intended for general use.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will reflect any changes.
